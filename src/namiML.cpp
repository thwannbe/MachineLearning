/// @details namiML framework supports multiple machine learning algorithms. @n
///          Some algorithms require different forms of inputs or training @n
///          data. Be careful not to adapt wrong type of data before executing @n
///          the program. The following is the list of machine learning algorithms @n
///          which are supported by this program and the input specifications.

/// @b CONCEPT @b LEARNING - BASED ON CANDIDATE ELIMINATION ; @n
///                    This assume that all input is a conjunction of binary @n
///                    attribute with a target attribute as its training data. @n
///                    Also training data must have no error. @n
///                    New instance which will be predicted should have same number @n
///                    of attributes like training data except for target attribute. @n
///                    All attributes must be clear(i.e. 1-true or 0-false). @n @n
